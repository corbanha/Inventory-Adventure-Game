# Inventory-Adventure-Game
The basis for an adventure game in Java complete with Inventory, store, and enemies

This is an inventory adventure game that I created a while back. It has all of the functionality of buying items in a store with manna and gold costs and weight. With classes extending each other to support differnt types of objects that can be used for battle or other edible items for healing. It also has some basic implementation of enemies that you would attack with some basic attacks but I never got around to actually creating a story around the game.
